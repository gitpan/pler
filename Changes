Revision history for Perl extension pler

0.15 Mon  1 Jan 2007
	- Converted from Devel::Pler to just pler.pm to allow
	  for better installation and documentation on search.cpan.
	- You can now "cpan -i pler"

0.14 Fri 15 Sep 2006
	- exec() does not work on Win32 (and we assume cygwin).
	  Instead, use system() which uses more memory, but
	  does at least work.

0.13 Thu  3 Aug 2006
	- Bug fixes
	  (I honestly don't know his this crap gets out to CPAN)

0.12 Thu 25 Jul 2006
	- Show the list of scripts with no params, or run script
	  if there is only one in the t directory.
	- When verbose is off, comment on the script name for clarity
	- Copying the POD in the Devel::Pler for better toolchain
	  compatibility.
